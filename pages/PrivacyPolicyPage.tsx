            <p><span className="font-bold">Important Disclosure:</span> ukclaims.org is not a law firm, a solicitors’ referral service, or an insurance company. We do not provide legal advice or regulated claims management services directly.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><span className="font-bold">No Solicitor-Client Relationship:</span> Your use of the Site, or any communication with our representatives, does not create a solicitor-client relationship between you and the Company or any Marketing Partner. A solicitor-client relationship is only formed if you sign a formal engagement letter directly with a regulated law firm or FCA-authorised claims management company.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><span className="font-bold">You do not have to use a claims management company.</span> You can pursue a claim yourself for free by contacting the responsible lender directly, and if you are not satisfied with the outcome you can refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service (<a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">financial-ombudsman.org.uk</a>) or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (<a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">fscs.org.uk</a>) free of charge.</p>
